## Moving A Laravel Webpack Project To Vite

Now we need to set up Vite. Therefore create a new vite.config.js file in the root of your Laravel application.

import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin'
import {defineConfig} from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
laravel([
'resources/css/app.css',
'resources/js/app.js',
]),
],
});

## Using Vite In Your Templates

@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

## Running Vite

To run Vite, you use the npm script npm run dev, which we have defined, which is just an alias for npm run vite.

It will compile your assets lighting fast! To make your assets production-ready, you can use the new npm run build script to version and bundle your assets.

In the background, Vite is using the new assets compiled to the public/build directory. This means we can delete the old asset folders, public/css and public/js, in my case.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
